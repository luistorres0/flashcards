# Flashcards

Welcome to my own flashcards app based on the project from Thinkful's Engineering Immersion program. This is only the frontend of the app. The original featured a mock JSON API implemented with [json-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server). This version features a real backend implemented with Node, Express, Knex, and a PostgreSQL database. However, the backend will be developed as a separate project.
